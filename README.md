## Papers:
This section covers some of the well-known paper for imbalanced learning and uncertainity estimation for regression tasks.
### Imbalanced Regression:
Imbalanced regression are the collection of method that try to increase model performances for 
the areas where model in unsure due to the lack of training data.
- [Balanced MSE for Imbalanced Visual Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16427) | [github]()
- [Density‑based weighting for imbalanced regression](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-021-06023-5) | []()
- [Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09554) | []()
### Uncertainity Estimation:
Uncertainity of the models and the data can be estimated with various methods which are usually
classified as (i) bayesian and (ii) non-bayesian methods.

#### (i) Bayesian Methods
- [Depth Uncertainty in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08437) | [github](https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/DUN)
- [Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142) | [github](https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/DUN) 
- 
#### (ii) Non-bayesian Methods
- [Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474)
